# Architectural Review: Preparation Document

## Software Design Final Project
### **Team interWEBS:** Gracey Wilson, Sam Eppinger, Sarah Barden, Rowan Sharman

**Feedback and decisions**

We were able to get some useful information for our project going forward.  Some text mining sites that students recommended were Wikipedia, EasyBib and Sparknotes, in order to find information about locations and publishers.  We also asked about other interesting book information and someone suggested it would be cool to see a book’s timeline of when it was written, published, printed, etc.  Also, if we want to find locations in plots, we can use project Gutenberg, but only for older books, or potentially SparkNotes for more popular ones.

Some new questions we generated are:
- What is the purpose of our project? Is it educational or fun?
- Will this be on one computer? Or should we make it a web app?
- Are their other reach goals we should try to reach?

**Review process reflection**

The review went pretty well. It seemed like our audience understood our project idea during our presentation and understood why we were doing what we were doing which indicated we gave them a good amount of context. We stuck to our planned agenda and asked our key questions and during the feedback from our peers, we also came up with a few more questions as the discussion went on. We had not really run into any actual problems by the time we had our review, so we didn’t have any super pressing questions to ask. You can always do more work to be more prepared, especially if you run into unexpected problems. Next time, it would probably be more effective to have a more fluid story and vision for our project. It also would have probably been useful to have more discussion with the peer reviewers, or have them test out our idea (have them test a “simulation” of our project to see if our idea is fun or not.
