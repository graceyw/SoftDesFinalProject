# Architectural Review: Preparation Document

## Software Design Final Project
### **Team InterWEBS:** Gracey Wilson, Sam Eppinger, Sarah Barden, Rowan Sharman

**What We Have Decided to Build:**

Our project takes a book’s ISBN and displays information about it on a map, like the locations of the author, publisher, and possibly plot of the book. The stretch goal for our project is to have the user click on the country, and it takes the user to Google Earth street view, so that they can walk around in that country or possibly the publishing company/author’s city.

**What We Want to Learn:**

- How might we make this more interesting for a user?
- What are some cool things you would want to know about a book?
- Do you know of any sources we could text mine from? Wikipedia?
- Do you have suggestions for more efficient architecture?


**Agenda:**

- Introduction to project (Context & Stretch Goal) - 2 min

- Explain architecture of our code (include who is doing what) - 5 min
